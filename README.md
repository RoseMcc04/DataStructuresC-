# DataStructuresCPP Introduction

Hello, my name is Rose McCormack and I am a student studying computer science with an eventual emphasis in security and development. I wanted to teach myself data structures in a language that was object-oriented, but more efficient than Java or C#. That is why I decided to start teaching myself general basics of C++, along with conceptual ideas for creating my own algorithms.

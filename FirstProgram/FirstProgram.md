- `#include <iostream>`: <br>
    - `#` means to do first (before you compile the rest of the code) <br>
    - `include` means include this library or header in your program <br>
    - `iostream` - a library with input and output functions (`cin`, `cout`) <br>

- `using namespace std`: <br>
    - means we do not have to specify the std first <br>
    - *e.g., if we did not say "using namespace std", we would have to specify std::cout instead of cout* <br>

- `int main() {` <br>
    - Every C++ (and C) program must have a main function <br>
    - This function is run first and automatically <br>
    - Like base camp, it is where you start, where you come back to, and where you end<br>

- `cout << "!!!HelloWorld!!!" << endl;` <br>
    - `cout`: character out; You are piping characters into `cout` and they get printed, usually to the console <br>
    - `endl`: new line; Also flushes out the buffer <br>
    - `//`: comments <br>
    - Note that every line ends with a `;` <br>
